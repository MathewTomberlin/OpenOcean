# Open Ocean VR
Open Ocean VR was a game developed by Mathew Tomberlin, Ryan Blakeman, Jason Ferrer and Emily Turnage for the California State University, 
Monterey Bay 2018 Capstone class and festival. The game utilized the Oculus Rift and Oculus Move controllers to allow a player to interact
with and learn about marine creatures from within a virtual reality environment. The game was meant to be an immersive learning experience
for those who might not otherwise have access to an aquarium.

#Developing Open Ocean
Mathew Tomberlin was responsible for all 3d models, animations, movement behaviors, spawning behaviors and designer tools and minigame 
questing system during the development of Open Ocean VR. In order to develop the VR game, Mat also developed a non-VR version for 
prototyping, design and debugging without a headset. This version, simply called Open Ocean, was developed exclusively by Mathew Tomberlin 
and represents a very similar product to the final game, without the need for a VR headset.
